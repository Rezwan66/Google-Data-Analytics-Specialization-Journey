# Google-Data-Analytics-Specialization-Journey
My experience of completing the complete Google Data Analytics course (8/8 courses completed) offered by Coursera.

Iâ€™m ecstatic to share that I have finally completed the Google Data Analytics Specialization from Coursera!

It started as a skill-gaining endeavor during the quarantine lockdown but ended up being a career-turning realization for me in the Data Analytics field!!!

From this certification, I have learned the fundamental phases of the data analysis process:
**Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, & Act**.

Moreover, it helped sharpen my skills on
- _how to ask the right questions to answer a business problem, and_
- _which data to collect, clean and process for the analytical process._

I also learned how to
- _improve my analytical thinking abilities_
- _checking for the credibility of a dataset_
- _avoid common biases_
- _organizing and transforming the data_
- _extracting key insights from our analysis to answer the business question, and_
- _effectively visualizing and presenting the insights to the stakeholders to suggest a solution to the business problem._

Furthermore, I have gained technical skills in **Excel/Google Sheets, SQL, R programming, and Tableau** which are invaluable to me. I had a blast playing around with the various powerful visualization tools and libraries of R Studio and Tableau Public.
